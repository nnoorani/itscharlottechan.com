          <p class= "quote">&#8220;Charlotte went above and beyond in her duties as a Technical Project Coordinator during her time at Kontagent. She was exceptionally smart, displayed outstanding initiative, and was always up for new tasks and challenges. Not only did she complete her primary responsibilities diligently and professionally, she also made significant contributions to employee morale and office culture, going as far as to take on additional office management tasks, organizing team/company events, and improving employee health and morale through improved lunch catering options. Charlotte has exceptional organization and execution skills, and I would not hesitate to recommend or hire her again in the future.&#8221;

          <p class= "quote">&#8220;[Charlotte's] enthusiasm towards all tasks is wonderful and she is willing to help wherever possible regardless of the activity. She has been able to work independently...and her interaction with the other co-ops within ITS has been positive..Charlotte was also able to participate in client workshops and the work there was very high quality and detailed. Given that this is only her second work term, she has exceeded expectations around managing her time, the quality of her deliverables and her interactions with the team and clients. I would encourage Charlotte to look for opportunities to manage projects and teams in future work terms&#8221;

          <p class= "quote">&#8220; As a new employee, she was able to quickly grasp the scope of the work, despite the lack of experience in the telecommunications and fiber optic field. She
            was able to learn SpatialNET effortlessly and was responsible for updating equipment installations in our
            Rogers SpatialNET system. She later moved on to being responsible for working on the design of new
            implementation projects under the supervision of Equipment Engineering Specialists. Her open personality was immediately accepted by her fellow coworkers and made her an excellent candidate for collaborative work with other departments. Charlotte always finishes her work prior to deadlines and utilizes her multi-tasking abilities very well. I am happy to say her work ethics and determined personality made her a perfect fit in the Rogers community. Charlotte's outstanding performance during the work term propelled me to extend a part-time position to her as she returned to school.&#8221;
